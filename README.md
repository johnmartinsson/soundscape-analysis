# Soundscape analysis
A repository for soundscape analysis using machine learning.

Feel free to update the README with other useful sources along the way!

I Just added some generic training code I have used before in run.py and utils.py, it is incomplete, and not necessarily the way to go.

## Datasets
- [SoundData](https://github.com/soundata/soundata)

## Data Augmentation
- [Scaper](https://github.com/justinsalamon/scaper)
- [audiomentations](https://github.com/iver56/audiomentations)

## Useful Python libraries
- [librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/index.html)
- [torchlibrosa](https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/torchlibrosa)
